            <p class="biography__text">Alan Turing was a mathematician, cryptographer, marathon runner and known as the father of computer science. Throughout his childhood he was a brilliant student, maths and numbers were too easy for his curious and outstanding mind. He always wanted to learn more would not ever stop experimenting and testing his ideas. His first day at high school, he had to go on a bike for 96 Km due to a strike, it was such a great achievement that even local press talked about it. <br>
            He went to King's college, cambridge and afterwards he attended to Princeton. After his uncountable advances in computing and cryptography, not to mention his help to finish the second world war, he was found guilty of <i>gross indecency and sexual perversion</i> due to his sexual orientation, as homosexuality was illegal back then. He was asked to choose between going to jail or being chemically castrated; he picked the second option, which brought him a lot of physical changes and thus, loads of suffering. In 1954 he died from eating a cyanide-poisoned apple, which many decades later inspired the famous technology company's logo, Apple.</p>
